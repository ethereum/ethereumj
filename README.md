# Goals

The ethereumj library is a Java implementation of the Ethereum protocol.

This repository currently contains:
 * [core](ethereumj-core): the core library which can be included into your own Java project.
 * [studio](ethereumj-studio): a simple graphic interface for Ethereum functionality and set of showcases for core usage.

For an early peek, have a looki at this [video](https://youtu.be/D5ok7jh7AOg)

# Todo

The Ethereum protocol is currenty heavily in development, thus so is this implementation.
You can find a todo-list right [here](TODO.md) and the [milestone schedule](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj/milestones).
For questions you can reach us in #ethereumj on Freenode.

# Documentation

To start you can visit [Ethereum.org](https://www.ethereum.org) and if you are looking for more information on the concept, the [ethereum white paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper) is a good place to start as it outlines the vision. For the more technical minded, a protocol description can be found in the [yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf) by Gavin Wood.

# Maven

The main ethereumj library can be found in the Maven repository

https://bintray.com/ethereum/maven/org.ethereum/view

For building ethereumj-core or ethereumj-studio look in their own individual README
