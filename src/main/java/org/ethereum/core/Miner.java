/**
 * The Miner performs the proof-of-work needed for a valid block
 * 
 * The mining proof-of-work (PoW) exists as a cryptographically secure nonce
 * that proves beyond reasonable doubt that a particular amount of computation 
 * has been expended in the determination of some token value n. 
 * It is utilised to enforce the blockchain security by giving meaning 
 * and credence to the notion of difficulty (and, by extension, total difficulty). 
 * 
 * However, since mining new blocks comes with an attached reward, 
 * the proof-of-work not only functions as a method of securing confidence 
 * that the blockchain will remain canonical into the future, but also as 
 * a wealth distribution mechanism.

	 * Adds a nonce to given block which complies with the given difficulty
	 * 
	 * For the PoC series, we use a simplified proof-of-work. 
	 * This is not ASIC resistant and is meant merely as a placeholder. 
	 * It utilizes the bare SHA3 hash function to secure the block chain by requiring 
	 * the SHA3 hash of the concatenation of the nonce and the header’s SHA3 hash to be 
	 * sufficiently low. It is formally defined as PoW:
	 * 
	 * 		PoW(H, n) ≡ BE(SHA3(SHA3(RLP(H!n)) ◦ n))
	 *
	 * 	where:
	 * 		RLP(H!n) is the RLP encoding of the block header H, not including the
	 *			final nonce component;
	 *		SHA3 is the SHA3 hash function accepting an arbitrary length series of
	 *			bytes and evaluating to a series of 32 bytes (i.e. 256-bit);
	 *		n is the nonce, a series of 32 bytes;
	 *		o is the series concatenation operator;
	 *		BE(X) evaluates to the value equal to X when interpreted as a
	 *			big-endian-encoded integer.
	 * 
	 * @param block without a valid nonce
	 * @param the mining difficulty
	 * @return true if valid nonce has been added to the block
